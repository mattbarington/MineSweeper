# MineSweeper
Simple Minesweeper GUI

# Install and Run
- clone the repo (you've probably already done that)

- `./gradlew`. It's that easy.

## If it isn't that easy
This project was built with Java 8, and this version of gradle is incompatible with versions of java later than java 8.
You probably need to install jdk or Java 8.
